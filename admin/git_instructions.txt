To create a repository:
  ** NOTE **
  ** NOTE **
  ** on the git-hub website it has a step that has you doing: **
  ** !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THIS IS COMPLETE CRAP !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  **
  git remote add origin https://github.com/username/Hello-World.git
  ** !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THIS IS COMPLETE CRAP !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  **
  ** If you do that you will have to **
  ** give username+password !!!!! FOR EVERY DAMN PUSH !!!!!!! **
  ** Instead do this:
    git remote add origin git@github.com:cary-miller/hello-world.git
  ** NOTE **
  ** NOTE **


To create a repository:
    You have to come at it from both ends.  You create a repo
    on git-hub.  Also create a repo locally.  Then the command
    above ties them together.  Here is the entire procedure.

1.  On git-hub, create a repo.  It is easy.
2.  Locally there is more work.
    cd git-repo
    mkdir bar
    cd bar
    git init
    vim README
    git add README
    git commit -m 'foo' README
    git remote add origin git@github.com:cary-miller/bar.git 
    git push -u origin master
3.  Local changes should now show up on git-hub.

sez
this occurs because you did

    git clone https://github.com/username/repo
    instead of

    git clone git@github.com:username/repo.git
